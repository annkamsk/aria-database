Pisen Rusalky O Mesiku (Song of the Moon), Rusalka's aria from Rusalka

Mesiku na nebi hlubokem			O moon high up in the deep, deep sky,
Svetlo tvé daleko vidi,			Your light sees far away regions,
Po svete bloudis sirokém,		You travel round the wide,
Divas se v pribytky lidi.		Wide world peering into human dwellings

Mesicku, postuj chvili			O, moon, stand still for a moment,
reckni mi, kde je muj mily		Tell me, ah, tell me where is my lover!
Rekni mu, stribmy mesicku,		Tell him. please, silvery moon in the sky,
me ze jej objima rame,			That I am hugging him firmly,
aby si alespon chvilicku		That he should for at least a while
vzpomenul ve sneni na mne.		Remember his dreams!
Zasvet mu do daleka,			Light up his far away place,
rekni mu, rekni m kdo tu nan ceka!	Tell him, ah, tell him who is here waiting!
O mneli duse lidska sni,		If he is dreaming about me,
at'se tou vzpominkou  vzbudi!		May this remembrance waken him!
Mesicku, nezhasni, nezhasni!		O, moon, don't disappear, disappear!
