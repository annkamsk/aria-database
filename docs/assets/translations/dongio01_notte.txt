Notte e giorno faticar, Leporello's aria from Don Giovanni

Notte e giorno faticar,		Day and night slaving away,
Per chi nulla sa gradir,	For someone who is never satisfied,
Piova e vento sopportar,	Rain and wind to put up with,
Mangiar male e mal dormir.	Eating badly and sleeping badly.
Voglio far il gentiluomo	I want to be a gentleman
E non voglio piu' servir...	And I don't want to be a servant anymore...
Oh che caro galantuomo!		Oh what a chivalrous gentleman!
Vuol star dentro colla bella,	He wants to stay inside with the beauty (beautiful woman),
Ed io far la sentinella!	And I am the lookout!
Voglio far il gentiluomo	I want to be a gentleman
E non voglio piu' servir...	And I don't want to be a servant anymore...
Ma mi par che venga gente;	But it seems like someone's (people) coming;
Non mi voglio far sentir.	I don't want to let anyone (hear me) know I'm here.
