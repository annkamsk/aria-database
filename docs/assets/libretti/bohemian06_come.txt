Come with the Gipsy bride, Arline's aria from The Bohemian Girl

Come with the Gipsy bride,
And repair to the fair,
Where the mazy dance
Will the hours entrance!

Come with the Gipsy bride,
Where souls as light preside!
Life can give nothing beyond
One heart you know to be fond,
Wealth with its hoards cannot buy
The peace content can supply,
And rank in its halls cannot find
The calm of a happy mind.

Come with the Gipsy bride,
And repair to the fair,
Where the mazy dance
Will the hours entrance!

Love is the first thing to clasp,
But if he escape your grasp,
Friendship will then be at hand,
In the young rogue's place to stand,
Hope will then be nothing loath
To point out the way to both.

Come with the Gipsy bride,
And repair to the fair,
Where the mazy dance
Will the hours entrance!
