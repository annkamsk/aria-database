Come away, fellow sailors, The sailor's aria from Dido and Aeneas

Come away, fellow sailors, come away,
Your anchors beweighing:
Time and tide will admit no delaying,
Take a bowsey short leave of your nymphs on the shore
And silence their mourning with vows of returning,
Tho' never intending to visit them more.
