I'm called Little Buttercup, Buttercup's aria from HMS Pinafore

Hail, men-o'-war's men -- safeguards of your nation
Here is an end, at last, of all privation;
You've got your pay -- spare all you can afford
To welcome Little Buttercup on board.

For I'm called Little Buttercup -- dear Little Buttercup,
	Though I could never tell why,
But still I'm called Buttercup -- poor little Buttercup,
     Sweet Little Buttercup I!

I've snuff and tobaccy, and excellent jacky,
     I've scissors, and watches, and knives;
I've ribbons and laces to set off the faces
     Of pretty young sweethearts and wives.

I've treacle and toffee, I've tea and I've coffee,
     Soft tommy and succulent chops;
I've chickens and conies, and pretty polonies,
     And excellent peppermint drops.

Then buy of your Buttercup -- dear Little Buttercup;
     Sailors should never be shy;
So, buy of your Buttercup -- poor Little Buttercup;
     Come, of your Buttercup buy!
