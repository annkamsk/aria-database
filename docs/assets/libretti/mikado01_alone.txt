Alone, and yet alive, Katisha's aria from The Mikado

Alone, and yet alive!
Oh, sepulchre!  My soul is still my body's prisoner!
Remote the peace that Death alone can give --
My doom, to wait!  my punishment, to live!

Hearts do not break!  They sting and ache
For old love's sake, But do not die,
Tho' with each breath They long for death,
As witnesseth The living I, The living I.

Oh, living I!  Come, tell me why,
When hope is gone, Dost thou stay on?
Why linger here when all is drear?
Oh, living I!  Come, tell me why,
When hope is gone, Dost thou stay on?
May not a cheated maiden die?
May not a cheated maiden die?
