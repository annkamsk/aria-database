Summertime, Clara's aria from Porgy and Bess

Summertime, and the livin' is easy, 
fish are jumpin', and the cotton is high. 
Oh yo' daddy's rich, an' yo' ma is 
good lookin', 
so hush, little baby, don' you cry.
One of these mornin's you gonna rise up 
singin', 
then you'll spread yo' wings an' you'll take 
the sky. 
But 'til that mornin' there's-a nothin' can 
harm you 
with Daddy an' Mammy standin' by.
