Bliss forever past, the Gypsy Queen's aria from The Bohemian Girl

O would that I had died ere now,
For then I had not felt
The bitter pang, the crushing blow,
Thy cruel words have dealt!
I've but one solace, heaven grant
It cheer me to the last!
'Tis sad, fond memory, faithful still
To bliss forever past.

But no! but no! not one poor ray
Of comfort will be mine;
No gleam of hope, however faint,
Will through my sorrow shine!
That sorrow is so sharp, so great,
Its power so deep, so vast,
That even the memory will it crush
Of bliss forever past.
