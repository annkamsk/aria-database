A soldier's life, Count Arnheim's aria from The Bohemian Girl

A soldier's life
Has seen of strife
In all its forms so much,
That no gentler theme
The world will deem
A soldier's heart can touch;

[Chorus]
Away to the hill and glen,
Where the hunter's belted men
With bugles shake the air!

[Solo]
Ah; who can tell, save he who feels
The care a parent's love reveals,
How dear, fond thing, thou art
To this lone, widowed heart!

[Chorus and soloist together]
Away to the hill and glen,
Where the hunter's belted men
With bugles shake the air!
