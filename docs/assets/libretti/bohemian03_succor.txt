Is no succor near at hand?, Florestein's aria from The Bohemian Girl

Is no succor near at hand?
For my intellect so reels,
I am doubtful if I stand
On my head or on my heels;
No gentleman, it's very clear,
Such a shock should ever know;
When I once become a peer,
They shall not treat me so;

Then let every vassal arm,
For my thanks he well deserves,
Who from this state of alarm
Will protect my shattered nerves!
To think that one unused to fear
Such a fright should ever know!
When I once become a peer,
They shall not treat me so!
