Love smiles but to deceive, the Gypsy Queen's aria from The Bohemian Girl

'Tis gone, the past was all a dream,
The light of life is o'er;
The hope that once so bright did seem
Now shines for me no more,
now shines for me no more.
Ah! foolish heart, without a thought,
In joy that didst believe,
Nor knew, what many a tale has taught,
Love smiles but to deceive,
love smiles, love smiles to deceive,
love smiles to deceive.

No more I'll join the dance and song,
Or mingle with the gay,
And, happy as the day is long,
Beguile the hours away,
beguile the hours away.
I'll seek me out some silent spot
In solitude to grieve,
And learn, what many a tale has taught,
Love smiles but to deceive,
love smiles, love smiles to deceive,
love smiles to deceive.
