'Tis sad to leave our Fatherland, Thaddeus's aria from The Bohemian Girl

Without friends, and without a home,
my country, too! yes, I'm exiled from thee;
what fate, what fate awaits me here, now!
Pity, Heaven! oh calm my despair.

'Tis sad to leave our Fatherland,
And friends we there loved well,
To wander on a stranger strand,
Where friends but seldom dwell;
Yet, hard as are such ills to bear,
And deeply though they smart,
Their pangs are light to those who are
The orphans of the heart!

Oh! if there were one gentle eye
To weep when I might grieve,
One bosom to receive the sigh
Which sorrow oft will heave;
One heart the ways of life to cheer,
Though rugged they might be,
No language can express, how dear
That heart would be to me!

'Tis hard to leave our Fatherland ...
And friends we there loved well,
To wander on a stranger strand,
Where friends but seldom dwell!
