My man's gone now, Serena's aria from Porgy and Bess

My man's gone now, 
ain' no use a-listenin' 
for his tired footsteps 
climbin' up de stairs. Ah...
Ol' Man Sorrow's 
come to keep me comp'ny, 
whisperin' beside me 
when I say my prayers. Ah...
Ain' dat I min' workin', 
work an' me is travelers 
journeyin' togedder 
to de promise land. 
But Ol' Man Sorrow's 
marchin' all de way wid me 
tellin' me I'm ole now 
since I lose my man.
Ol' Man Sorrow sittin' by de fireplace, 
lyin' all night long by me in de bed. 
Tellin' me de same thing mornin, noon an' 
eb'nin', 
that I'm all alone now since my man is 
dead. Ah... 
Since my man is dead!
